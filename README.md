The website and blog for the Death by Numbers project.

## Theme

The theme is custom-designed using TailwindCSS. To get started with developing the theme, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. 

```
npm install -y
```

Then, anytime TailwindCSS components are added to a layout or content file, you can re-generate the side-wide CSS using the script in `package.js`:

```
npm run build-tw
```
