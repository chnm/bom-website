title: "Death by Numbers"
---

Between 1603 and 1752, almost 8,000 different weekly bills were published, chronicling plague and general mortality through the city of London. One of the major aims of the Death by Numbers project is to transcribe and publish the information in these bills in a dataset suitable for computational analysis.
