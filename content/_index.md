title: "Death by Numbers"
---

One of the most dreaded diseases in early modern England was plague. London, England, suffered six major epidemics in the century between 1563 and 1665, and lost an estimated 225,000 people to plague. Government officials attempted to quantify the severity of various plague outbreaks. Starting in 1603, they published Londonâ€™s weekly mortality statistics in broadside series known as the Bills of Mortality. The bills grew to include not just plague deaths but also dozens of other causes of death, such as childbirth, measles, syphilis, and suicide, ensuring their continued publication for decades after the final outbreak of plague in England. 

Between 1603 and 1752, almost 8,000 different weekly bills were published. 

Death by Numbers aims to transcribe and publish the information in these bills in a dataset suitable for computational analysis.
